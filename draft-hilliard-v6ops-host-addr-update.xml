        The IPv6 Host Address Availability Recommendations Best Current
        Practice (RFC 7934), describes why IPv6 hosts should use multiple
        global addresses when attaching to a network.  This document updates
        RFC 7934 by removing a recommendation for networks to give the host the
        ability to use new addresses without requiring explicit requests.

      <t>

        The IPv6 Host Address Availability Recommendations Best Current
        Practice document <xref target="RFC7934" /> describes why IPv6 hosts
        should use multiple global addresses when attaching to a network. 
        The recommendations in Section 8 of this document included the text:
        
      </t>

      <t><list><t>

        Due to the drawbacks imposed by requiring explicit requests for
        address space (see Section 4), it is RECOMMENDED that the network
        give the host the ability to use new addresses without requiring
        explicit requests.

      </t></list></t>

      <t>

        This text could be interpreted as recommending that IPv6 networks
        should not use not DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3736" />, which provides
        new addresses in response to explicit requests.  This interpretation
        is based on the fact that a host which uses DHCPv6 IA_NA or IA_TA
        cannot use new addresses without requesting them from a DHCPv6
        server on the network.

      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Updates to RFC7934">
      <t>

        This document updates <xref target="RFC7934" /> to remove the second
        and third paragraphs of Section 8, so that the recommendations
        section of <xref target="RFC7934" /> reads in its entirety as
        follows:
        
      </t>

      <t><list><t>

        In order to avoid the problems described above and preserve the
        Internet's ability to support new applications that use more than
        one IPv6 address, it is RECOMMENDED that IPv6 network deployments
        provide multiple IPv6 addresses from each prefix to general-purpose
        hosts.  To support future use cases, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to impose
        a hard limit on the size of the address pool assigned to a host. 
        Particularly, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to limit a host to only one IPv6
        address per prefix.
   
      </t></list></t>

    <section title="Rationale">

      <t>

        It has been argued in the v6ops Working Group that the first
        sentence second paragraph technically relegates the status of DHCPv6
        to "NOT RECOMMENDED" on IPv6 networks, as it formally recommends
        that new addresses should be assigned without explicit requests. 
        This implicitly excludes all address assignment mechanisms,
        including DHCPv6, which are not handled by the host itself.  A
        change of this form to the status of DHCPv6 would be a serious and
        substantial change to the status of DHCPv6 at the IETF, and not one
        that could or should have been entertained without extensive debate
        as to whether it was an appropriate move to make.  This debate never
        happened and the justification provided in section 4 of <xref
        target="RFC7934" /> is insufficient per-se to warrant changing the
        recommendation status of such a widely-deployed Standards Track
        protocol as DHCPv6.

      </t>

      <t>

        The IPv6 self-selection addressing model does not necessarily suit
        the deployment requirements for many types of ipv6 networks,
        including enterprise, provider hosting, and various access network
        protocols (e.g.  docsis / gpon / ipoe); if the status of DHCPv6 were
        changed to "NOT RECOMMENDED", then there would be no recommended
        IETF model for stateful / operator-assigned IPv6 addressing, and
        this would leave a glaring hole in the IPv6 host specification.

      </t>

      <t>

        The subsequent sentences in the second paragraph provide
        alternatives to DHCPv6, and are superfluous in the absence of the
        first paragraph.

      </t>

      <t>

        The third paragraph notes that DHCPv6 stateful address assignment
        (IA_NA or IA_TA) can be used to provide multiple addresses when the
        host connects to the network, but does not mention that the host can
        issue multiple dhcpv6 requests, thereby allowing arbitrary numbers
        of assignments rather than the stated limit of approximately 30.  As
        the text in this paragraph is incorrect, it too has been removed.
